# Blog App - README.md
This project was made by following along with the Modern React with Redux tutorial made by Stephen Grider on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/content.  This app creates a blog and allows creation of new posts, viewing of individual posts, list of all posts, and deletion of individual posts.  React router and redux were both used alongside react.
