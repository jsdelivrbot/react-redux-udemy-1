# Project Overview
This project was made while following with tutorial done by Stephen Grider on Udemy.  
https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/content

This app gets forecast data for a user-entered city and then displays three graphs
displaying temperature, pressure and humidity.  If an api key is available for google
maps, the code can be modified to include a map instead of the city name in the table.
