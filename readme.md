# Modern React with Redux Udemy Tutorial
#### Instructor: Stephen Grider
Link: https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/content

This repo was created in Fall 2017 as I began to learn React.  The course covers basic React concepts and introduces Redux.  The instructor covers the concepts over the course of creating 4 separate apps.  See each separate README.md for a brief intro to each app.

#### NOTE:
Some apps use an API key which is not kept in this repo.  You will need to get your own key if you wish to fully run some applications.
